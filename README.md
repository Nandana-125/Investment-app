# Light House 

This is a FlutterFlow and Firebase based project called LightHouse , which is an online investment app that connects investors and start ups based on their mutual interests. This was the Major project during my BCA course at CHRIST (Deemed to be Universiy)  along with my classmate Sandra Benny. This repository includes all the flutterflow files. For more information about the project and screenshots of the app kindly go through the FINAL REPORT pdf which is uploaded in this repository:) 

## Getting Started

FlutterFlow projects are built to run on the Flutter _stable_ release.
